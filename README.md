# Laravel + Unstyled React JSX Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our Laravel + Unstyled React JSX starter kit provides a lightweight and flexible foundation for building Laravel applications with React JSX (inertia), without any predefined styles. It includes a built-in authentication system and provides unstyled views and layouts, allowing you to customize them as you wish. You can install your favorite libraries and CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, NES.css, Alpine, etc., or choose not to use any framework at all and design everything from scratch.
